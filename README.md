# Lumen Astro starter

A contemporary Astro 5 scaffold with an island-based navigation bar, flexible marketing sections, and modern styling. Use it as a starting point for product or content-driven sites that value performance and clarity.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Ship production assets: `npm run build` (optionally preview with `npm run preview`).

## Tech stack
- [Astro 5](https://astro.build) with strict TypeScript defaults
- React island for the navigation, hydrated on load
- Modern, responsive styling with a focus on accessibility and contrast
