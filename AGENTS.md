# AGENTS

This repository is small, so keep guidance concise and easy to follow.

## Purpose
- Capture lightweight instructions so an agent can onboard quickly.
- Keep edits focused and easy to review.

## What to read first
- Start with `README.md` for project context and update it if you change the top-level purpose.
- Review this file before committing changes and keep it succinct (aim to avoid long instruction lists).

## Contribution workflow
- Work in small, reviewable changes; keep diffs focused on the stated task.
- Prefer clear Markdown for documentation and comments; avoid unnecessary boilerplate.
- When adding instructions, favor universally applicable guidance over task-specific notes.

## Coding practices
- Keep functions and files short and readable; remove dead or duplicate code.
- Maintain consistent naming and formatting; prefer standard tools over custom helpers when possible.
- Add or update tests/checks when behavior changes; document how to run them if non-obvious.

## Version control
- Write meaningful commit messages that describe the change.
- Ensure the repository is clean (`git status`) before finishing a task.
