# Diagnostics outputs and examples

Short references for what teams receive from each diagnostic. Share these links alongside
requests so stakeholders know what to expect.

## Burden Modeler

- Burden index score with a short narrative that flags friction and extraction hotspots.
- Pattern language references for each hotspot with suggested mitigations.
- Off-ramp reminder for complex findings that need studio facilitation.

## LLM Capacity Benchmark

- Readiness summary showing consent and context handling gaps with suggested fixes.
- UI-level nits tied to pattern language filters to guide remediation work.
- Off-ramp reminder for risky or ambiguous findings that should go to a facilitated session.

## Maintenance Simulator

- Scenario runs that surface coverage gaps, outage handling, and appeal pathways.
- Communication templates mapped to risk levels, roles, and escalation paths.
- Off-ramp reminder pointing teams to a facilitated deep dive when simulations stall.

## Technical Capacity Forecaster

- Side-by-side projections showing baseline versus remediated capacity across 24 months.
- Saturation callouts and refusal window notes for stakeholder review.
- PDF snapshot export that accompanies delivery planning and portfolio reviews.

## Server-side rendering check

- Live runtime snapshot showing rendered timestamp, request ID, and request headers.
- Refresh control to confirm per-request SSR behavior and cache bypass.
- Off-ramp link back to diagnostics index for teams that need a deeper readiness check.
