# Formatting and tooling

- Format Markdown and code with Prettier defaults (`bunx prettier --write`), matching existing
  quoting and spacing.
- Lean on built-in Astro and TypeScript strictness; avoid introducing new linting or formatting
  stacks without need.
- Keep line wraps near 100 characters in Markdown to match existing docs.
