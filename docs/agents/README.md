# Agent guidance

This folder collects the detailed AGENTS guidance that was split out of the root file.

## Quick start

- Locate any scoped `AGENTS.md` with `rg --files -g 'AGENTS.md'` before editing files.
- Skim `repo-orientation.md` to find the right directory for your change.
- Follow `workflow-and-checks.md` for the required commands and commit expectations.
- Use `formatting-and-tooling.md` when you need formatting or linting guidance.

## Contents
