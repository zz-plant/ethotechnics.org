# Review checklist

- Is the change scoped to the smallest sensible set of files and updated docs where readers
  expect them?
- Did you run the required checks and keep the repository clean (`git status`) before finishing?
- Are new conventions captured in the relevant `AGENTS.md` (or README) to keep guidance localized?
- Did you update any affected docs or tests when behavior or scripts changed?
