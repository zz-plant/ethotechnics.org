    <p>
      Across healthcare, housing, banking, employment, and public benefits, automated decision
      pipelines execute at computational speed while contestation remains trapped in human time.
      The result is not just bad decisions, but ungovernable cascades: state changes that propagate
      faster than any appeal mechanism can halt, often without ever becoming a contestable
      decision at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Temporal Governance Studies is the study of how power operates through time, attention, and
      reversibility in high-speed administrative systems. When execution is cheap and continuous
      but redress is slow, institutions can harm without denying—by delaying, resetting clocks,
      routing people through verification loops, and avoiding decision objects that would trigger
      appeal. The resulting injuries are temporal (missed windows, pendingness), cognitive
      (overload, interruption, resumption failure), and procedural (proof burdens, recursion,
      auto-closure), and they stratify society by buffer capacity: who can persist, retry, hire
      advocates, or delegate to agents versus who collapses after ordinary human imperfection. The
      remedy is not better intentions or clearer explanations but enforceable constraints: bounded
      timelines, stable clocks, continuity of state, safe pause, traceable ownership, appeal
      surfaces, override paths, and measurable emissions limits that can be audited, procured
      against, and litigated.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Ethotechnics convenes this program to diagnose velocity-driven governance failures, design
      reconciliation and circuit-breaker architectures, and specify enforceable patterns that
      preserve speed and contestability.
