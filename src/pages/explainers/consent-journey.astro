  "A consent journey maps the full lifecycle of consent from initial request to renewal, revocation, and expiration. It treats consent as a sequence of explicit choices rather than a single checkbox.",
  "Strong consent journeys issue receipts and log every change so people can prove what they agreed to and when.",

    answer:
      "Renewal should match risk and sensitivity; higher-risk data flows warrant shorter renewal windows and clear reminders.",

    answer:
      "Auditability requires receipts for every consent state change, plus logs that tie the change to scope, purpose, and owner.",
