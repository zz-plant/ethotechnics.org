  "Time-to-Halt (TTH) measures the latency between a user or operator requesting a stop and the system actually halting. It turns stoppability into a measurable service-level requirement with clear thresholds.",
  "Teams use TTH to shrink the window for unwanted actions and to verify that halt controls are not merely cosmetic.",
