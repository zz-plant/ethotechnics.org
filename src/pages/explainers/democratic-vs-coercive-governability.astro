  "Coercive governability is control infrastructure that optimizes for compliance and extraction without enforceable rights, independent oversight, or repair obligations.",

  "A benefits platform exposes appeal routes, repair SLAs, and human escalation. A coercive counterpart offers only one-way notices, no reversal pathway, and opaque denial tooling.";
