const definition = [
  "Design authority identifies the accountable owner empowered to approve, change, or halt a system’s design. It prevents diffusion of responsibility by naming a steward with decision rights.",
  "Clear design authority ties governance decisions to a person or office that can sign off on risks and remediation.",

  "A platform names a Design Authority for its recommender system and requires that role to sign off on any changes to ranking logic or safety thresholds.";

      "Product ownership focuses on delivery goals, while design authority carries governance power to approve, halt, or remediate based on ethical risk.",

    question: "What happens when authority changes?",
    answer:
      "Update the authority record, issue a receipt for the handoff, and ensure prior decisions remain traceable to the former owner.",
