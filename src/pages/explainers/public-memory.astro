    <p>
      Contestability terms travel through policy, procurement, and public narratives. When a term
      like “responsible AI” becomes a label rather than a measurable commitment, people lose the
      ability to demand remedies. This page preserves the original intent behind governance
      language so it can be cited with precision.
