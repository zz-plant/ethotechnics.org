  "Ethical interrupts are explicit checkpoints that pause automation when ethical risk thresholds are crossed. They require a human review or deliberate confirmation before the system proceeds.",
  "Well-designed interrupts are visible, logged, and tied to a reversible path so the pause itself becomes accountable.",

  "A content moderation pipeline triggers an ethical interrupt when model confidence drops below a threshold and harm severity is high, routing the case to a human reviewer.";

      "They add deliberate friction only at risk thresholds, preserving speed for low-risk cases while protecting people in high-stakes flows.",
