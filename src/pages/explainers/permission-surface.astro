  "The permission surface is the full set of permissions and access points a system grants or requests across its lifecycle. It shows where authority is delegated, revoked, or escalated so teams can see hidden exposure.",
  "Managing the surface helps prevent silent privilege creep and supports consent-driven governance.",

      "Consent states what people agree to, while the permission surface shows every system-level access point that must honor that consent.",

    question: "What tooling helps map the surface?",
    answer:
      "Use access inventories, role-based access reviews, and automated permission diff reports tied to receipts and change logs.",
