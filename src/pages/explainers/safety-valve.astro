const definition = [
  "A safety valve is a mechanism that releases pressure when systems are overloaded, uncertain, or error-prone. It creates a safe fallback path, often human-led, instead of allowing harmful automation to continue unchecked.",
  "Safety valves keep accountability intact during exceptions by making the fallback visible and logged.",
];

const example =
  "During a surge in automated appeals, the system routes high-risk cases to a human review queue instead of auto-denying to meet deadlines.";
