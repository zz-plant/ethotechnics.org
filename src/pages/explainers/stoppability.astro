  "Stoppability is the requirement that people can halt an automated process instantly without losing their place or facing penalties. It centers on visible stop controls, state preservation, and the ability to walk away without retribution.",
  "Teams use stoppability to prevent forced tunnels and to prove that systems respect human time and agency.",

      "Cancellation ends a process, while stoppability ensures people can pause or halt it immediately without losing state or being penalized for stopping.",

    question: "What evidence demonstrates stoppability?",
    answer:
      "UI recordings of the halt control, event logs showing immediate cessation, and receipts proving state preservation are the core proofs.",
