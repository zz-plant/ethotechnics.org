  "A repair log is a chronological record of remediation actions taken after a system causes harm or errors. It links each repair to a receipt, owner, and resolution status so corrections remain visible and auditable.",
  "Teams use repair logs to prove that remedies happened and to detect recurring failure patterns.",
