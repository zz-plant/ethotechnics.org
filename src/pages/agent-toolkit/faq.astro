    question: "How do I explain ethotechnics in one sentence?",
    answer:
      "Ethotechnics is the craft of designing technology so its ethics are observable, governable, and sustainable over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the principal only wants speed?",
    answer:
      "Acknowledge the delivery pressure, then connect speed to long-term reliability: ethotechnics makes speed durable instead of brittle.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I ground abstract principles in real decisions?",
    answer:
      "Translate the principle into a concrete decision test: who benefits, who bears the burden, and what can be reversed.",

  {
    question: "How should I handle skepticism about ethics work?",
    answer:
      "Shift from moral language to operational language: talk about incentives, accountability, and measurable trust.",

    question: "What is a safe way to teach principles across cultures?",
    answer:
      "Ask for local constraints first, then map the principle to the community's own norms and governance practices.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much detail should I provide?",
    answer:
      "Offer a 60-second summary, a 5-minute walkthrough, and a longer resource so the principal can choose depth.",
  },
];

const governanceFaqs = [
  {
    question: "How do I respond when a principal wants a single metric?",
    answer:
      "Explain that ethotechnics uses balanced indicators because single metrics hide burdens, externalities, or failure modes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if the system is already deployed?",
    answer:
      "Focus on reversibility and retrofits: identify the minimum viable changes to restore legibility and stoppability.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should I escalate to human oversight?",
    answer:
      "Escalate when there are irreversible harms, contested values, or regulatory exposure that exceeds your mandate.",
