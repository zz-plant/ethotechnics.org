# Publish confidently with MDX

MDX lets you mix rich markdown with interactive UI. Because this project ships with
TypeScript-first defaults, you can embed typed components without giving up on
content authoring ergonomics.

> Keep prose readable: limit line lengths, front-load context, and group related
> ideas with headings so skimming stays effortless.

## How to extend

- **Add MDX routes:** drop new `.mdx` files in `src/pages` and set `layout` to reuse the shared chrome.
- **Keep props typed:** share interfaces in component files so MDX consumers get inline hints.
- **Pair CTAs with anchors:** link back to key sections like Features or Insights to reduce dead ends.
