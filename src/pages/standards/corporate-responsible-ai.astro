      Corporate responsible AI standards typically combine principles (fairness,
      transparency, safety) with committees, review gates, training, and monitoring.

        <strong>Centralized review becomes a bottleneck:</strong> At scale, boards
        either slow the business or become routinized and symbolic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Judgment-based governance is fragile:</strong> Under deadline pressure,
        discretionary controls degrade first while the system keeps running.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The affected party lacks standing:</strong> Governance is inward-facing,
        not power the public can exercise.

    <p>
      The failure mode is a well-intended program that collapses into symbolic
      oversight when incentives conflict with restraint.
