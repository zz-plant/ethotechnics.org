      Ethotechnics is a mechanism-first discipline for turning safety and ethics goals into
      concrete design and operational decisions for agents\u2014things that can be specified, built,
      tested, audited, and owned.
    </p>
    <p>This practice exists to answer a single question:</p>

      \u201cWhat must be true, structurally, for an agent to be safe to operate?\u201d
