          <h2>Preamble: The Doctrine of Finitude</h2>
          <p>
            We hold that human attention is a finite, non-renewable biological
            resource. In the Machine Age, the disparity between the infinite
            speed of automated systems and the fixed processing speed of the
            human mind has created a structural crisis of dignity.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a system wastes human time through negligence, obfuscation, or
            coercive design, it is not merely a "bad user experience"; it is a
            Temporal Taking—an unauthorized extraction of life. It is measurable
            as a time tax with durable costs and documented burden.
          </p>
          <p>
            To defend the human subject against the scale of the machine, we
            establish these seven inalienable rights. Any system that violates
            these articles is declared non-compliant with STD-01.
