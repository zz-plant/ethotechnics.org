          <h2>Preamble: The Doctrine of Finitude</h2>
          <p>
            We hold that human attention is a finite, non-renewable biological resource. In the
            Machine Age, the disparity between the infinite speed of automated systems and the
            fixed processing speed of the human mind has created a structural crisis of dignity.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a system wastes human time through negligence, obfuscation, or coercive design,
            it is not merely a "bad user experience"; it is a Temporal Taking—an unauthorized
            extraction of life.
          </p>
          <p>
            To defend the human subject against the scale of the machine, we establish these
            seven inalienable rights. Any system that violates these articles is declared
            Non-Compliant.

            "No system shall force a user to complete a process they wish to abandon."

            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§1.1</span>
              Immediate Cessation: Every active process must possess a clearly visible,
              universally accessible mechanism to halt operation immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§1.2</span>
              Preservation of State: Halting a process must not result in the punitive destruction
              of data. The system must save the "Paused State" for a reasonable duration, allowing
              the user to return without penalty.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§1.3</span>
              The Prohibition of The Tunnel: No interface may lock a user into a linear sequence
              (a "wizard" or "flow") without a permanent exit option available on every screen.

            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§2.1</span>
              The Universal Exit: A user must be able to sever their relationship with a system
              (delete account, unsubscribe, cancel contract) with equal or lesser friction than
              was required to create it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§2.2</span>
              The One-Step Rule: If entry required one click, exit shall require no more than one
              click.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§2.3</span>
              Prohibition of Retention Scripts: Systems may not force users to navigate "retention
              flows," "exit surveys," or "confirmations of loss" as a prerequisite for resignation.
              These act as Constructive Denial by artificially inflating the cost of leaving.

            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§3.1</span>
              The Hard Clock: Every system state must have a defined maximum duration. "Pending,"
              "Processing," or "Reviewing" states cannot persist indefinitely.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§3.2</span>
              The Timeout Guarantee: If a system cannot resolve a request within a declared
              timeframe, it must default to a failure state or a human escalation. It may not loop
              forever.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§3.3</span>
              Estimation of Burden: Before a user commits to a process, the system must declare the
              estimated time to completion. Concealing the duration of a task to secure engagement
              is a violation of consent.

              <span class="standard-clause-id">§4.1</span>
              The Undo Window: For any action with consequential effects (deletion, transfer,
              publication), the system must provide a "Grace Period" during which the action can be
              reversed without administrative intervention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§4.2</span>
              Non-Destructive Defaults: Systems shall not permanently destroy user data based on a
              single input. "Soft Delete" (archival) must be the default engineering state for all
              removal actions.

              <span class="standard-clause-id">§5.1</span>
              Visibility of Queue: When a user is placed in a waiting state, the system must
              provide accurate, real-time telemetry regarding their position and expected wait
              time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§5.2</span>
              The Prohibition of False Activity: Systems shall not use "fake progress bars,"
              "placebo buttons," or looping animations to simulate activity when the system is
              idle or stalled.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§5.3</span>
              Asynchronous Option: No user shall be forced to hold an active connection (keep a
              window open, stay on the phone) to maintain their place in a queue. Systems must
              offer callback or notification options for waits exceeding 5 minutes.

              The Escalation Path: Any automated decision that denies a user access, service, or
              property must include a clearly defined path to appeal to a human agent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="standard-clause-id">§6.2</span>
              The Liability of Automata: A system may not hide behind "algorithmic error." The
              operating institution accepts full liability for the latency and errors of its
              automated agents.
