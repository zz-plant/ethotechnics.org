    <p>
      FHIR is how U.S. healthcare systems move data between payers, providers, and
      regulators. If refusal and repair are not in the exchange substrate, they vanish at
      the moment a decision crosses organizational boundaries.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Ethotechnics treats refusals, appeals, and repair as first-class healthcare data so
      intervention rights remain visible, time-bound, and enforceable in every system that
      touches the decision.
