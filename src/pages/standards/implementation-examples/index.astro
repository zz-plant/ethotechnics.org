    <p>
      Standard AI governance tends to add oversight processes to existing systems.
      Ethotechnics requires re-architecting the system so that stoppability, contestability,
      and reversibility are embedded in runtime behavior. These comparisons make the
      difference concrete by focusing on decision velocity, intervention authority, and
      recovery time.
