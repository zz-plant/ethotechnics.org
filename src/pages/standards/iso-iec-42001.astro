    <p>
      ISO/IEC 42001 specifies how organizations set up, implement, and maintain
      an AI management system, including roles, policies, objectives, and continual
      improvement cycles.

    <ul class="card__list">
      <li>
        <strong>Governance effort ≠ governability:</strong> Audits can certify documented
        controls while the system remains hard to stop mid-incident.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Continuous improvement can normalize slow harm:</strong> “We’re improving”
        can coexist with multi-quarter remediation cycles in high-stakes contexts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Artifacts over interruption capacity:</strong> Documentation, training, and
        lifecycle governance are easier to evidence than tested rollback authority.

    <p>
      The failure mode is a system that passes audits while users still cannot
      compel reversal on a clock.
