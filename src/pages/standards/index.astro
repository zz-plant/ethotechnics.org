    description="A declarative comparison for regulators, operators, and risk owners."
  >
    <p>
      Most AI governance standards in use today are built to answer: “Did you
      manage risk responsibly?” Ethotechnics is built to answer a different
      question: “Can this system be stopped and repaired when it is harming
      someone?” This is not a difference of values. It is a difference of
      mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many regimes improve documentation, oversight, and monitoring. Those are
      useful. But in high-stakes systems, the dominant failure mode is now
      temporal: decisions occur at machine speed while reversal occurs at
      institutional speed. In that gap, harm compounds.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Ethotechnics treats governability as an operational capability with
      measurable performance properties.

          Common standards (including EU AI Act “human oversight” obligations)

    <p>
      Ethotechnics does not compete with existing standards on whether
      governance is “important.” It addresses what most standards leave
      undertreated: when harm is occurring, can your system be compelled to
      stop—quickly, reliably, and without requiring the harmed person to carry
      the burden?
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      That is the difference between governance as documentation and governance
      as capability.
