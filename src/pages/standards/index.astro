    description="A declarative comparison for regulators, operators, and risk owners."
  >
    <p>
      Most AI governance frameworks document risk, assign responsibility, and
      demonstrate good-faith compliance. Ethotechnics treats governance as an
      operational property of the system itself: whether harmful processes can
      be stopped, paused, reversed, and contested while they are happening.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">The differences below are structural, not philosophical.</p>

    <div class="grid grid--two">
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="eyebrow">1. Operational stoppability vs. risk management</p>
        <p class="muted">
          Common standards (NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001) focus on identifying,
          assessing, documenting, and managing risks across the AI lifecycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethotechnics:</strong> Requires proof that harmful processes
          can be halted during operation. Risk assessment is secondary to
          demonstrated stoppability; if a system cannot be stopped on demand, it
          is ungovernable regardless of documentation quality.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="eyebrow">2. Runtime control vs. compliance programs</p>
        <p class="muted">
          Common standards implement governance through policies, review gates,
          audits, and organizational roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethotechnics:</strong> Governance is implemented as a runtime
          control plane: stop rules, binding clocks, rollback paths, and
          restoration mechanisms that execute in real time. Policies describe
          intent. Control planes constrain behavior.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="eyebrow">3. Recovery time vs. documentation completeness</p>
        <p class="muted">
          Common standards measure maturity through inventories, audit trails,
          risk registers, and process coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethotechnics:</strong> Measures governance through recovery
          metrics: time to halt harm, time to restore access or correct
          decisions, and time a person remains exposed while a system is “under
          review.” If recovery is slow, governance has failed—even if
          documentation is flawless.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="eyebrow">4. Structural authority vs. advisory oversight</p>
        <p class="muted">
          Common standards rely on ethics boards, responsible AI committees, and
          human-in-the-loop review to exercise judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethotechnics:</strong> Distributes structural veto power
          across multiple perspectives (legal, community, adversarial). These
          perspectives do not advise; they possess architectural authority to
          stop processes. Oversight is not a meeting. It is a capability.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="eyebrow">5. Temporal constraints vs. pre-deployment prediction</p>
        <p class="muted">
          Common standards emphasize pre-deployment impact assessments,
          conformity checks, and post-deployment monitoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethotechnics:</strong> Treats time as the primary ethical
          resource. Systems must operate at speeds that preserve the
          possibility of human intervention. The governing question is not
          “what might happen?” but “how long can this continue once it starts?”
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="eyebrow">6. Contestability vs. transparency</p>
        <p class="muted">
          Common standards prioritize explainability, disclosures, and
          transparency obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethotechnics:</strong> Prioritizes contestability with teeth.
          Being able to understand a decision is insufficient if it cannot be
          challenged and reversed on a clock. Transparency without reversibility
          is informational, not protective.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="eyebrow">7. Built-in enforcement vs. external surveillance</p>
        <p class="muted">
          Common standards (EU AI Act, state laws) rely on regulators and
          enforcement bodies to detect violations and impose penalties after
          deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethotechnics:</strong> Embeds enforcement inside the system
          itself. External regulators verify that stop mechanisms exist and
          work—but are not relied on as the primary brake for fast-moving harm.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <p class="eyebrow">8. Constraint satisfaction vs. ethical optimization</p>
        <p class="muted">
          Common standards frame ethics as principles to balance—fairness,
          accuracy, innovation, safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ethotechnics:</strong> Treats certain constraints as
          non-negotiable. If a system cannot be stopped, reversed, or contested
          by affected parties, it does not meet the minimum bar for deployment,
          regardless of performance gains.
