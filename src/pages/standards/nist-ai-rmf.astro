    <p>
      The AI RMF is explicitly not a checklist. It emphasizes mapping risks,
      measuring performance, and managing controls across the AI lifecycle.

    <ul class="card__list">
      <li>
        <strong>Risk framing privileges prediction over control:</strong> “Map/Measure”
        improves anticipation and documentation but does not force operational reversibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Voluntary + profile-driven:</strong> Organizations can adopt maturity-shaped
        artifacts without building hard stop or rollback infrastructure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Governance becomes management activity:</strong> The RMF supports internal
        practice but does not require demonstrations that a running system can be halted quickly.

    <p>
      The failure mode is a well-documented process that still leaves people
      exposed while the institution “manages risk” on a slow clock.
