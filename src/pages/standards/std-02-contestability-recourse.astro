          <h2>Preamble: The Doctrine of Contestability</h2>
          <p>
            We hold that any system exercising consequential power over people
            must remain corrigible: capable of being challenged, reviewed,
            reversed, and repaired. In the Agentic Age, the speed and opacity of
            automated action creates a structural legitimacy gap: execution
            happens in milliseconds, while human redress often takes days,
            weeks, or never arrives.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a system cannot be contested—when no one can see what happened,
            no one is obligated to listen, and no one can restore what was
            taken—the system becomes arbitrary power, regardless of its average
            accuracy or stated principles.
          </p>
          <p>
            To defend human agency against unreviewable automation, we establish
            these articles. Any system that violates them is declared
            non-compliant with STD-02.

              Vendor non-evasion: Vendor contracts may not eliminate contestability
              obligations; if vendors hold the logs or controls, the operator must
              still guarantee access and remedy.

              Remedy budget: Systems must fund review capacity proportional to action
              throughput; increasing automation without scaling appeals is non-compliant.
