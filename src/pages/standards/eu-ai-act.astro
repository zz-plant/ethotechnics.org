    <p>
      The EU AI Act establishes obligations for high-risk systems, requires human
      oversight, and enforces compliance through EU and national authorities.

    <ul class="card__list">
      <li>
        <strong>Compliance is document-mediated:</strong> Conformity assessment and
        technical documentation improve accountability but do not ensure fast intervention.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Human oversight is underspecified:</strong> Oversight obligations do not
        impose recovery-time targets or stoppability drills.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>External enforcement is slower than harm:</strong> Market surveillance can
        deter and punish, but it is not a primary braking system for compounding harm.

    description="Compliance can coexist with prolonged pending states and slow restoration."
  >
    <p>
      The failure mode is a system that is compliant yet still traps people in
      extended “pending” states without enforceable restoration timelines.
